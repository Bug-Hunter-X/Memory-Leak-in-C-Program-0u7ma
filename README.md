This repository contains a C program with a memory leak and its solution. The program demonstrates improper memory allocation and the steps to fix it. The bug is that the program does not check if malloc returns NULL, meaning that memory allocation might fail. It also doesn't free the allocated memory. The solution handles the potential memory allocation failure and frees the allocated memory.
